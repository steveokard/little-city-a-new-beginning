# Chapter Four

Aidan shows Defecto to his new room onboard the space station. The room has a window view near the top of the station which reveals how large it actually is. Defecto was at awe that it stretches well beyond his own point of view. "This is amazing, Aidan!" Defecto looks around the place while Aidan smiles and adds that he can watch TV stations at HQ or from other planets, including his own, to mayor's delight. 

Aidan walks over to the mayor and hands him a card contianing containing a matrix barcode that could be used to shop and trade anywhere in the station. On the top right was a thin LED-like screen that showed the balance. "10Ʉ?" Defecto tilts his head. "I know it's money. It just doesn't seem like a lot."

"Oh but it is. Ʉ is the smybol used for CryptoUnit." Aidan smiles as he wags his tail. "All companies working in the planetary industry have what's known as a cryptocurrency. Ya' know that open source money you hear so much about," the mouse chuckles. "CryptoUnit is ours. It's used internally to trade goods within our own ecosystem, both in space or on the ground. Everything else, like exchange rates, you should be familar with. Clearly, Zenon hopes that'll encourage to his way."

Defecto scratches his head, "but that wouldn't you loose the grasp to control it?" 

"Not entirely." Aidan ends his explanation by adding that paper money was impossible to scale. The technology's ability to scale combined with the built-in safe guards, such as keeping track of inflation, was a worthy trade off for the lack of any central authority. "10Ʉ won't buy you a planet but it will get you a sweet place while you're here." Aidan provides a list of locations he could use to get public access to his wallet as well as the method needed to unlock it. "You'll need this."

"I," Defecto looks around. "I... Thank you. Before now, my life was back on planet Shy. Now I don't know anymore."

"Huh," Aidan tilts his head. "I don't think Zenon anticipated this."

Later, back at Zenon's office. The door opens to reeal Defecto.

"I will do it!" Defecto yells to Zenon. "On one condition: I'm staying here."

"Huh." Zenon walks up to the little mouse. "Aidan told me about how you were feeling. He is right. I didn't see this coming."

"Can you do that, Mr..?"

"Call me Zenon or Zen. Zenon Tigerpaw is my full name. TPaw means Tigerpaw too," the tiger smiles before looking up and thinks to himself. "We are prepared to send down a new mayor, president, you name it, anywhere for any situation. Little City is no expectation. That being said, they still do work for us. You are welcome to be in charge of that division, just in case."
