# Chapter Four

Aidan shows Defecto to his new room onboard the space station. He explains that he can watch TV stations at HQ or from other planets, including your own, to Defecto's amzement. Aidan then hands him a card contianing the information to access his cryptocurrency-based wallet. "The company has no control over it regulates itself, similar to your world's Bitpaw. TPaw only keeps track of which wallet belongs to who and lets the public ledger speak for itself."

"10Ʉ?" Defecto tilts his head. "I know it's money. It just doesn't seem like a lot."

"Oh but it is. Ʉ is the smybol used for CryptoUnit." Aidan smiles as he wags his tail. "All planetary companies have what's known as a cryptocurrency. Ya' know that open source money you hear so much about," the mouse chuckles. "We use them to trade planets. Everything else, like exchange rates, you should be familar with. Clearly, Zenon hopes that'll encourage to his way."

Defecto scratches his head, "but that wouldn't you loose the grasp to control it?" 

"Not entirely." Aidan ends his explanation by adding that paper money was impossible to scale. The technology's ability to scale combined with the built-in safe guards to keep inflation down was a worthy trade off for the lack of any central control. "10Ʉ won't buy you a planet but it will get you a sweet place while you're here."

"I," Defecto looks around. "I... Thank you. Before now, my life was back on planet Shy. Now I don't know anymore."

"Huh," Aidan tilts his head. "I don't think Zenon anticipated this."

Later, back at Zenon's office. The door opens to reeal Defecto.

"I will do it!" Defecto yells to Zenon. "On one condition: I'm staying here."

"Huh." Zenon walks up to the little mouse. "Aidan told me about how you were feeling. He is right. I didn't see this coming."

"Can you do that, Mr..?"

"Call me Zenon or Zen. Zenon Tigerpaw is my full name. TPaw means Tigerpaw too," the tiger smiles before looking up and thinks to himself. "We are prepared to send down a new mayor, president, you name it, anywhere for any situation. Little City is no expectation. That being said, they still do work for us. You are welcome to be in charge of that division, just in case."
