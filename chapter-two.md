# Chapter Two

"So this is Little City," Aidan Cheddar, a representative to Zenon Tigerpaw says, looking up at the surroundings. "TPaw's mice division taught us about this place in history class."

"Yes," Defecto nods. "You're not from here?"

Aidan laughs, "I'm not from anywhere here."

Aidan explains that he is a citizen of the TPaw Corp. Defecto, not a custom to this standard of living, tilts his head at the representative in confusion. Aidan goes on to explain that TPaw Corp. owns thousands of planets across the solar system. Each company competes to make a better planet which is done by advancing civilizations within them.

"This," Defecto pauses. "Is a lot to take in. How come I never heard of you?"

"TPaw Corp. prefers to intervene only if it gives them edge," Aidan replies, scanning the surroundings. "Little City caught the eyes of one of our secretaries, Mia. She noticed you were on the verge of becoming the first in this planet to achieve independence in energy production."

"Does that provide some kind of award?" Defecto scratches his head.

"Not literally. As I said," Aidan continues. "TPaw Corp. only intervenes if it gives them a competitive edge. You being the first attract investors and customers to this world."

"But we're only mice," Defecto points out, puzzled.

"Exactly."

"Wait wha?"

Aidan stops and walks in front of Defecto, "small creatures like us are often prized. Look how much you have advanced using what is commonly considered household items to the larger world."

Defecto raises his eyebrow, "I never thought of that." He runs up to Aidan, "I thought corporations were bad at running societies."

Aidan nods, "they are."

"Zenon let's say you that?"

Aidan glance over at Defecto, "there is a reason we are not that big here or any of our worlds. Some of our competitors have tried to run a civilianization on their own but it usaslly ends in dictatorship." He sighs, "look, Zenon brought me here because he wants to meet you. It's easier to do it back at HQ."

"But about the citizens?"

"We got that covered."
