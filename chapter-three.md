# Chapter Three

Defecto and Aidan are taken into a elevator after their ship docks at TPaw Corp.'s HQ, a large space station surrounding a nearby planet. Once they reach the lobby, Aidan takes Defecto to the nearest shop to find new clothes. His outfit is a early 21st century formalwear.

Defecto, tilts his head, "I thought it would be appropriate."

Aidan, searching new clothes to wear, "yeah, well," he looks at two pairs of causal differing style shirts, "when you work in the  planetary  bussines, what you wear is the least of your worries."

"So why do you care?" Defecto taps his foot.

"Because," Aidan drops clothes on Defecto, "just because we don't care, doesn't mean we don't think you look over dressed. He is a CEO, not a king." Aidan takes a moment to think about that before adding, "not that it hasn't stopped them from trying."

Later, in Zenon's office.

Zenon looks up at the ceiling, "Computer," he waits a moment for it register his voice. "Where is market cap compared to the Furry Blue Company?"

"TPaw is growing rapidly thanks to the company's non-intervention approach," Zenon's computer replies. "We've seen 40% growth over tim-" Zenon's office door bell rings, interrupting the computer.

Zenon turns around as the door opens, revealing Aidan and Defecto. "Welcome to TPaw! I see Aidan got you out of that formal wear."

The two mice walk into Zenon's office. The tiger, Zenon, presses a button that reveals apart of the flooring where the mice are standing to be one of many hovering platforms designed for smaller creatures. Defecto jumps and grabs a hold of Aidan, who remains still, as they hover near Zenon's desk.

Aidan shrugs, "I told him he was overdressed."

"Well, yes," Zenon nods. "You were, but that's nothing to worry about. No time was lost. It's pretty irreverent in this business unless you're want to talk to our higher ups or regulators. Then it pays to wear formalwear. Anyway, Mia, my secretary, told us about your city after informing me. You could use a hand."

"Yes, but," Defecto lets go Aidan. "How?"

"However you wish," Zenon laughs. "I have an idea on what you may need but you're welcome to chip in."

"I had an idea," Defecto looks around the space station. "Then I realized we arn't alone in the universe."

"Yeah," Zenon shrugs, "our business model does tend to leave our citizens to your planets a tad clueless of the true reality of space." The tiger decides to move in front of his desk and sit on it.

"Does he always do this?" Defecto looks over Aidan in curiosity.

"It's not often he gets visitors from his planets," Aidan whispers.

"So, Mayor..."

"Defecto."

"Thank you," Zenon nods and takes a mental node. "I was thinking of helping you with your resource problem. Aidan most likely told you that we don't often intervene. However, we both could each other."

"Keep going," Defecto nods in interest.

"I supply the resources needed to grow Little City," Zenon adds. "In exchange, your city will become very popular both in TPaw and the greater planetary market. As a bonus, we can advance the planet's space program. Deal?"

"Can I think this over?"

"Sure. Aidan will show you to your room."
