# Chapter Four

"Some corperations wish to make themselves known within those planets while others prefer to work in the shadows or under a different industry in the world," Mr. Defecto types into his pad. "TPaw works in the shadows. They prefer to watch us from the distance and bring in resources, only if the situation gives them advantage. But I can't complain. They're willing to help us move forward, even if it does give them a competitive edge in a market unknown to all of us." Defecto puts his pad down and looks up Aidan.

"So," Aidan looks over the pad. "Want to check out the space station?"

"Do I ever!"
