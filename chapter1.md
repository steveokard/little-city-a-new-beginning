# Little City

"You wouldn't think in the vast of nothingness that is normally space there would be life elsewhere. In fact, you are not alone in the universe. This planet is one of many planets maintained owned by corporations. Some corperations wish to make themselves known within those planets while others prefer to work in the shadows or under a different industry in the world," Mr. Defecto.

Little City is a city of mice. Not much tends to go on in this small but active metropolis. However, Little City has fallen into hard times as of recently. The current mayor is unable to keep up with the growing crime caused by the lack of resources to keep up with the growing number of residents.

"Zenon," Mia, secretary to Zenon.

"Look at this world," Zenon waves his hand across the window out in the space. "It's so beiaitful."

Mia pauses and gulps, "we have a problem in Sector 23."

"Sector 23?" Zenon turns his head to Mia. "That's one of our most popular regions. What could be wrong?"

"It's Little City," Mia replies. "Located on Planet 23.5 in the Wellwood region."

Zenon faces Mia, having her full attention. "You've been catching up. What about it?"

"The city is running out of resources." Mia opens up a hologram of the city, "they need a new mayor."

"How advanced is that planet?"

"They're on the verge of exploiting of renewable energy resources, sir."

"Computer," Zenon looks slightly at the cieling. "Remind me to boost that planet's resources." He puts his hands into his pockets and back down at Mia, "thanks, Mia. You can go." Mia walks back to her office. "Computer, patch me threw to Little City, Wellwood. Planet 23.5."
